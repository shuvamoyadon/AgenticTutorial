## <span style="color: #E17055;">üß™ Python Implementation Example</span>

```python
import random  # For simulating scores and responses

# Step 1: Define simulated AI models (in reality, you'd use API calls)
def simulate_model_response(model_name, query):
    """Simulate responses from different AI models."""
    if model_name == "Model A":
        return f"Response from Model A to '{query}': This is a detailed answer with facts."
    elif model_name == "Model B":
        return f"Response from Model B to '{query}': Short and concise reply."
    else:
        return "Unknown model."

# Step 2: Basic evaluation metrics (simplified from the summary)
def evaluate_response(response, query):
    """Evaluate a response using simple metrics."""
    # Metric: Length (for completeness/quality)
    length_score = len(response) / 100.0  # Normalize (higher is better, max ~5)
    
    # Metric: Relevance (simple keyword match)
    keywords = query.lower().split()
    relevance_score = sum(1 for kw in keywords if kw in response.lower()) / len(keywords)
    
    # Metric: Accuracy (simulated random score for demo)
    accuracy_score = random.uniform(0.7, 1.0)  # Mock value between 70-100%
    
    # Aggregate: Average of scores (customizable weights)
    overall_score = (length_score * 0.3 + relevance_score * 0.4 + accuracy_score * 0.3) * 100
    return {
        "length_score": length_score,
        "relevance_score": relevance_score,
        "accuracy_score": accuracy_score,
        "overall_score": overall_score
    }

# Step 3: Sample Workflow
def run_evaluation(query, models):
    results = {}
    for model in models:
        # Query model
        response = simulate_model_response(model, query)
        
        # Process and evaluate
        scores = evaluate_response(response, query)
        results[model] = {
            "response": response,
            "scores": scores
        }
    
    # Step 4: Aggregate and rank
    ranked = sorted(results.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]["scores"]["overall_score"], reverse=True)
    return ranked

# Example usage
query = "What is the capital of France?"
models = ["Model A", "Model B"]

ranked_results = run_evaluation(query, models)

# Step 5: Present results (simple console output, like a dashboard)
print("Evaluation Results:")
for model, data in ranked_results:
    print(f"\n{model}:")
    print(f"Response: {data['response']}")
    print(f"Scores: {data['scores']}")
    print(f"Overall Score: {data['scores']['overall_score']:.2f}")

# Output example:
# Evaluation Results:
#
# Model A:
# Response: Response from Model A to 'What is the capital of France?': This is a detailed answer with facts.
# Scores: {'length_score': 0.62, 'relevance_score': 0.6, 'accuracy_score': 0.85, 'overall_score': 66.1}
# Overall Score: 66.10
#
# Model B:
# Response: Response from Model B to 'What is the capital of France?': Short and concise reply.
# Scores: {'length_score': 0.48, 'relevance_score': 0.4, 'accuracy_score': 0.92, 'overall_score': 59.2}
# Overall Score: 59.20

## <span style="color: #00B894;">üéØ Why Multi-Model Orchestration Matters for AI Quality Assessment?</span>

### **üîç Diverse Perspectives**
Different models provide varied reasoning and linguistic styles, reducing single-model bias.

### **‚úÖ Improved Accuracy** 
Cross-verifying answers across models helps detect errors and enhances factual reliability.

### **üìà Robust Evaluation**
Multiple outputs enable comparative scoring (e.g., LLM-as-judge) to choose the best response.

### **üõ°Ô∏è Fallback & Redundancy**
Ensures continuity if one model fails or gives poor output.

### **üìä Continuous Benchmarking**
Allows performance tracking of models over time and under different scenarios.

**‚úÖ Result**: Higher trust, better response quality, and more reliable AI systems.
